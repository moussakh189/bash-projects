# Vuln Suggester Script

This document is a detailed guide to understanding and using the `vuln_suggester.sh` script. Whether you’re new to cybersecurity or a seasoned penetration tester, this report will walk you through what the script does, how to use it, and when it’s the right tool for the job. The goal is to provide an explanation that leaves you confident in applying the script to your own security assessments.

## What Is the Vuln Suggester Script?

The `vuln_suggester.sh` script is a Bash tool that simplifies vulnerability analysis during security testing. It takes output from Nmap—a widely-used network scanning tool—and analyzes it to suggest potential vulnerabilities or exploitation steps for the services it finds. It can also integrate with SearchSploit, a tool that searches for known exploits, to provide additional insights.

In simple terms, the script does three main things:
- Reads Nmap scan results to identify open ports and the services running on them.
- Offers practical suggestions for testing or attacking those services based on common vulnerabilities.
- Optionally looks up known exploits for those services using SearchSploit.

This makes it a handy tool for anyone who wants to quickly move from scanning a network to identifying weak points, without having to manually research every service.

## When Should You Use the Script?

The `vuln_suggester.sh` script shines in specific situations where you need fast, actionable insights from Nmap scans. Here are the key scenarios where it’s most useful:

- **Penetration Testing:** During the early stages of a pentest, after scanning a target with Nmap, you can use the script to pinpoint services worth investigating further. It’s a great way to prioritize your efforts.
- **Capture The Flag (CTF) Competitions:** In time-sensitive challenges, the script helps you quickly decide which services to target, saving you valuable minutes.
- **Learning Cybersecurity:** If you’re new to the field, the script acts as a teacher by showing you what vulnerabilities might exist in common services and how to approach them.
- **Bug Bounty Hunting:** For hunters looking for quick wins, the script can highlight services with known issues, letting you focus on exploitable flaws.

In short, use this script whenever you’ve run an Nmap scan and want a fast, automated way to figure out your next steps in vulnerability testing.

## What You Need Before Using the Script

To use `vuln_suggester.sh`, you’ll need a few things set up on your system. Here’s what’s required:

1. **Nmap:** This is the network scanning tool that generates the input for the script. It must be installed and working. You can install it with:
   - On Ubuntu or Debian: `sudo apt install nmap`
   - On macOS: `brew install nmap`
   - On Windows: Download it from the official Nmap website at https://nmap.org/download.html

2. **SearchSploit (Optional):** This tool searches the Exploit Database for known vulnerabilities. It’s not required, but it makes the script’s output more detailed by including exploit suggestions. Install it with:
   - On Ubuntu or Debian: `sudo apt install exploitdb`

3. **Bash Environment:** The script is written in Bash, so you need a Unix-like system to run it. This includes Linux, macOS, or Windows with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Make sure Nmap is installed at a minimum. Without it, the script can’t do its job. SearchSploit is a bonus that adds extra value.

## How to Use the Script

The script is flexible and can be used in two main ways: by scanning a target directly or by analyzing an existing Nmap output file. Below are the instructions for both approaches, along with options to tweak its behavior.

### Running the Script with an IP Address

If you want the script to scan a target for you, just give it an IP address. Here’s how:

```bash
./vuln_suggester.sh 10.10.11.123
```

What happens:
- The script runs an Nmap scan on `10.10.11.123` with service detection enabled.
- It saves the Nmap results to a file, like `nmap_service_10.10.11.123.txt`.
- It generates a suggestions report in a file, like `suggestions_10.10.11.123.txt`.

This is the easiest way to use the script if you’re starting from scratch.

### Running the Script with an Nmap File

If you’ve already scanned a target and saved the Nmap output, you can feed that file to the script:

```bash
./vuln_suggester.sh nmap_output.txt
```

What happens:
- The script reads `nmap_output.txt` instead of running a new scan.
- It creates a suggestions report based on the services in that file.

This is perfect if you’ve already done your scanning and just want analysis.

### Customizing the Script with Options

The script offers a few command-line options to tailor its behavior:

- **Specify an Output File:** Use `-o` to name the suggestions report yourself.
  - Example: `./vuln_suggester.sh 10.10.11.123 -o my_report.txt`
  - This saves the suggestions to `my_report.txt` instead of the default name.

- **Skip SearchSploit:** Use `--no-searchsploit` to disable exploit lookups.
  - Example: `./vuln_suggester.sh 10.10.11.123 --no-searchsploit`
  - This is useful if you don’t have SearchSploit installed or want faster results.

- **See More Details:** Use `--verbose` to get extra information about what the script is doing.
  - Example: `./vuln_suggester.sh 10.10.11.123 --verbose`
  - This helps troubleshoot or understand the process better.

These options let you adapt the script to your specific needs, whether you want simplicity or more control.

## What the Script Outputs

The script creates a Markdown-formatted report that’s easy to read and act on. Here’s what you’ll find in it:

- **Header:** Shows the target (IP or file name) and when the report was created.
- **Service Suggestions:** For each open port and service, it lists tailored advice and, if SearchSploit is enabled, any known exploits.
- **Summary:** A quick list of all detected services at the end for reference.

### Example Report

Here’s a sample of what the output might look like for a target at `10.10.11.123`:

```
===========================================
      Vuln Suggester Report for 10.10.11.123      
      Generated: 2025-08-04 12:00 UTC
===========================================

- 22/tcp - ssh OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3
  > Suggestion: Test weak credentials or enumerate users with tools like hydra or medusa.
  > SearchSploit Results:
    No relevant exploits found.

- 80/tcp - http Apache httpd 2.4.18
  > Suggestion: Check for outdated software, fuzz directories with gobuster, or scan with nikto.
  > SearchSploit Results:
    "Title": "Apache HTTP Server 2.4.18 - Denial of Service"
    "CVE": "CVE-2017-9798"

==== Summary ====
Target: 10.10.11.123
Detected services:
- 22/tcp : ssh
- 80/tcp : http
```

In this example:
- For SSH on port 22, it suggests testing credentials because weak passwords are a common issue.
- For HTTP on port 80, it suggests multiple steps and flags a known vulnerability with a CVE number.

This format makes it clear what to do next and why.

## How the Script Works Under the Hood

Let’s break down how `vuln_suggester.sh` processes your input and builds its report. Understanding this can help you trust its suggestions and tweak it if needed.

### Step 1: Handling Input

The script first figures out what you’ve given it:
- If it’s an IP address (like `10.10.11.123`), it runs an Nmap scan with service detection (`-sV`) and saves the output.
- If it’s a file (like `nmap_output.txt`), it uses that directly.

It checks for errors, like missing files or Nmap not being installed, and stops if something’s wrong.

### Step 2: Reading Nmap Output

The script scans the Nmap output for lines about open ports, such as:
```
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3
```
It pulls out:
- The port and protocol (e.g., `22/tcp`).
- The service name (e.g., `ssh`).
- The version details (e.g., `OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3`).

If a service is unknown, it marks it as such and moves on.

### Step 3: Making Suggestions

For each service, the script offers advice based on typical weaknesses:
- **FTP:** Try anonymous login, a frequent misconfiguration.
- **HTTP:** Look for outdated versions or hidden directories.
- **SSH:** Test for weak passwords or old software.

These suggestions come from standard penetration testing practices, making them reliable starting points.

### Step 4: Checking for Exploits

If SearchSploit is enabled, the script searches for exploits tied to each service and version. It limits each search to 10 seconds to avoid delays, then adds relevant results—like CVE numbers or exploit titles—to the report. If nothing’s found, it says so.

### Step 5: Wrapping Up with a Summary

At the end, the script lists the target and all detected services in a concise summary. This lets you see everything at a glance without digging through the details.
